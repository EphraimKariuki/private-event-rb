# Private Event

A practice  site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

This project will requires us to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about foreign keys and class names (hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before).
